EduMood – Students Emotion Recognition System

This project is developed solely for academic and research purposes as part of the 
"Design of Artificial Intelligence Systems" course. 

Some components in this project build conceptually on open-source educational 
resources, including:
- DeepFace (Serengil et al.)
- Classroom Emotion Dashboard demo (Kevin Aguirre)
- Public academic examples for facial-emotion recognition

All reused elements are utilized strictly for learning, experimentation, and 
non-commercial research.

This project is not intended for commercial deployment and should not be used, 
distributed, or modified for commercial purposes.
